# Deployment and Operational Considerations

## Local Development

To run the application locally, you'll need to install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

### Frontend

1.  Navigate to the root directory.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`

### Backend

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the development server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

## Docker

The application can be run using Docker and Docker Compose.

1.  Build the images: `docker-compose build`
2.  Start the services: `docker-compose up`

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Security Best Practices

*   **CORS:** The backend is configured with a CORS whitelist. Ensure that only trusted origins are allowed.
*   **Rate Limiting:** The backend uses `slowapi` to rate-limit requests. Adjust the limits as needed.
*   **Security Headers:** The backend uses the `secure` library to automatically add security headers to all responses. These headers help to protect against common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking.
*   **External Tools:** When running external tools, ensure that they are executed in a sandboxed environment to prevent them from accessing sensitive resources. Use technologies like Docker containers or virtual machines to isolate the tools. Always be cautious when running tools from untrusted sources.
