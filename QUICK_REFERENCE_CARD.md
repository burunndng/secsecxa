## CORE STATEMENT (Say First)
> "I feel very sad because my lifelong bestie seems to be cutting ties for someone he's met some months ago."

**Then:** STOP. SILENCE. WATCH.

---

## RESPONSE CHEAT SHEET

### He Defends ("I haven't been cutting ties")
**You:** "I hear that's your experience. From my perspective, you distanced yourself. I'm not debating—I'm telling you what I felt."

### He Cries/Centers His Guilt
**You:** "I need you to hear me first. Can you sit with my sadness, not your guilt?"

### He Blames Girlfriend
**You:** "You can't control her feelings. But you CAN control whether you make time for this friendship. Will you?"

### He Uses Psychology ("I dissociate")
**You:** "Are you in therapy? Are you committing to show up, or telling me why you can't?"

### He Attacks You
**You:** "I'm not saying you're bad. I'm saying I'm sad. If you can't hear that, we're done."

### He Says "I care about you"
**You:** "Then show me. What does that care look like in concrete terms?"

✅ Text friend "I'm okay"
✅ Drink water
✅ Ground (5-4-3-2-1)
✅ Sleep

## THE ULTIMATE QUESTION
> "I'm not here to judge if you're good or bad. I'm here to tell you I'm sad. Can you listen?"

---

## REMEMBER
- You're not overreacting
- His avoidance ≠ your worth
- Block was self-respect
- 4 months left, not forever
- **Trust what you SEE, not what you HOPE**

---

## IF YOU NEED TO WALK AWAY
You don't need a reason. You don't need permission.

"This isn't working. I need you to leave."

**That's enough.**

---

*You've got this. This is just information-gathering.*

*Whatever happens, you'll be okay.*
