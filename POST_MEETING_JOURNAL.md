## THE UNBLOCKING DECISION

### Should I Unblock Him?

**My gut feeling right now:** YES / NO / NOT SURE

**Why:**



### Unblock Criteria Checklist:
- [ ] He took real responsibility (acknowledged, didn't just explain)
- [ ] He made specific commitments with days/times
- [ ] He showed genuine understanding of impact on me
- [ ] I felt heard

**How many criteria were met:** ___/4

### Decision:
- [ ] **Keep block for now.** Re-evaluate in 1-2 weeks based on his actions.
- [ ] **Keep block indefinitely.** This isn't salvageable right now.
- [ ] **Unblock after 2 weeks** IF he follows through on commitments.

---

## WHAT I NEED TO WATCH FOR

### In the Next 2 Weeks:

**If he made commitments:**
- [ ] Does he initiate contact or do I have to reach out?
- [ ] Does he follow through on the specific day/time he promised?
- [ ] Is he present or distracted when we connect?
- [ ] Does the pattern repeat or change?

**If he didn't make commitments:**
- [ ] Does he reach out at all?
- [ ] If he reaches out, is it to take responsibility or deflect?
- [ ] Am I feeling relieved by the distance or more anxious?

## 2 WEEKS LATER: Final Assessment

**Date:**

### The Pattern Is Clear Now

What I've observed over 2 weeks:



### My Decision:

- [ ] **UNBLOCK:** He's shown consistent follow-through and real change. I'm willing to cautiously rebuild while I'm still here.

- [ ] **KEEP BLOCK:** The pattern is repeating. He's not able to show up consistently. I'm protecting myself for these final months.

- [ ] **STAY OPEN TO FUTURE:** I'm keeping the block for now, but I'm open to reconnection down the line if he does real work on himself.
